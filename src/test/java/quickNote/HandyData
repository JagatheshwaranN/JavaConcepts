1. Method Overloading
=====================
MO - Method Overloading
1. Same method name with different parameters.
2. Criteria - Number of params, Type of params, Order of params. We can't overload
   only with order of params. We need different number or type of params.
3. Return Type and Access modifiers are not considered in MO.
4. VarArg method can be used in method overloading. But it takes least precedence.
5. Compiler calls the correct method with the help of number, type and
   order of params in method overloading.
6. Autoboxing and Widening is used along with method overloading. AB helps to
   convert the primitive type to its wrapper type and WD helps to convert the
   smaller data type to larger data type.
7. Compiler choose most specific /closest implementation while calling a method in
   method overloading.
8. Method Overloading works on reference type not based on the runtime object.

Notes:
======
1. Autoboxing and Unboxing may sometimes pays way for ambiguity in the MO.
2. Widening or Narrowing takes precedence over the Autoboxing and unboxing.
====================================================================================
2. Method Overriding
====================
1. Subclass method provides implementation for the method which is already in
   Superclass.
2. Criteria - Same method name, inheritance hierarchy, non-static methods, and
   not private methods.
3. Private and Static methods can't be overridden. Final class methods can't be
   Overridden.
4. Method Hiding involves creation of new method with same name in a subclass.
   It can be achieved with static methods.
5. Return of the overriding method can be same or covariant type [Sub type].
6. Visibility of access modifiers can be increased or maintained in same level
   but can't be decreased.
7. Checked Exception thrown by overriding method should be same as Superclass
   method or less than the Superclass method. But, overriding method can throw
   runtime exception.
8. Super Keyword can be used in Subclass overriding method to call the Superclass
   methods / members.
9. Superclass default constructor can be called automatically when the Subclass
   constructor is invoked.
10. Method Overriding works based on the runtime object rather than the reference
   type.
