1. Method Overloading
=====================
MO - Method Overloading
1. Same method name with different parameters.
2. Criteria - Number of params, Type of params, Order of params. We can't overload
   only with order of params. We need different number or type of params.
3. Return Type and Access modifiers are not considered in MO.
4. VarArg method can be used in method overloading. But it takes least precedence.
5. Compiler calls the correct method with the help of number, type and
   order of params in method overloading.
6. Autoboxing and Widening is used along with method overloading. AB helps to
   convert the primitive type to its wrapper type and WD helps to convert the
   smaller data type to larger data type.
7. Compiler choose most specific /closest implementation while calling a method in
   method overloading.

Notes:
======
1. Autoboxing and Unboxing may sometimes pays way for ambiguity in the MO.
2. Widening or Narrowing takes precedence over the Autoboxing and unboxing.
