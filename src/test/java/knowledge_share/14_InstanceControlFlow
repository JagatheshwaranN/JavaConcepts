Questions
=========
1. What is instance control flow in Java?
Instance control flow refers to the sequence of initialization of instance variables,
instance initialization blocks (non-static blocks), and the constructor invocation when an
object of a class is created.

2. Explain the order of execution for instance variables, instance blocks, and constructors
during object creation?
During object creation:
1. Instance variables are initialized in the order they are declared in the class.
2. Instance initialization blocks are executed in the order they appear in the class.
3. Constructor(s) are invoked after instance variables are initialized and instance blocks
are executed.

3. Can you have multiple instance initialization blocks within a class?
Yes, a class can contain multiple instance initialization blocks, and they are executed in the
order they appear in the class during object creation.

4. What happens if an instance initialization block throws an exception?
If an instance initialization block throws an exception, the object creation process fails, and
an error message is printed indicating the cause of the failure. The object will not be successfully
instantiated.

5. Explain the difference between static and instance initialization blocks.
Static initialization blocks are preceded by the static keyword and are executed when the class
is loaded into memory, whereas instance initialization blocks are not preceded by the static
keyword and are executed each time an object of the class is created.

6. How does the presence of inheritance impact the instance control flow?
Inheritance affects instance control flow by adding the initialization process of superclass
components before the initialization of subclass components. Superclass instance initialization
blocks and constructors are executed before subclass instance initialization blocks and constructors
during object creation.

7. Discuss the significance of instance initialization blocks in class design.
Instance initialization blocks are useful for performing common initialization tasks that need to
be executed for every object creation. They provide a way to initialize instance variables or
perform other initialization logic that cannot be accomplished within constructors.

8. Explain the concept of forward reference in instance initialization.
Forward reference occurs when an instance initialization block tries to access an instance variable
or method that is declared later in the class. This results in a compilation error because Java
requires all instance variables and methods to be declared before they are accessed.

9. How can you handle common initialization tasks shared across multiple constructors in a class?
You can use instance initialization blocks to centralize common initialization tasks shared across
multiple constructors. By placing initialization logic in instance initialization blocks, you can
ensure that it is executed regardless of which constructor is used to create the object.

10. Can instance initialization blocks access static variables and methods?
Yes, instance initialization blocks can access static variables and methods because they are
executed in the context of an object, and objects have access to both instance and static members
of a class.
