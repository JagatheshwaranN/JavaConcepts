Questions
=========
1. What is Encapsulation in Java?
Encapsulation in Java is the mechanism of wrapping data (variables) and code acting on the
data (methods) together as a single unit. It restricts direct access to some of the object's
components, which helps in preventing accidental modification of data and ensures that the
data remains consistent.

2. Why is Encapsulation important in Java?
Encapsulation is important in Java for several reasons:
1. It helps in maintaining the integrity of data by preventing it from being accessed directly.
2. It enables the implementation of access control through access modifiers.
3. It facilitates code organization and maintenance by grouping related data and behavior.

3. How do you achieve Encapsulation in Java?
Encapsulation in Java is achieved by declaring the variables of a class as private and providing
public getter and setter methods to access and modify these variables, respectively. This way,
the internal state of the object is protected, and controlled access is provided to the outside
world.

4. What are the benefits of Encapsulation?
Benefits of Encapsulation include:
1. Data Hiding: It hides the internal state of objects and only exposes necessary operations.
2. Modularity: It promotes modularity by separating concerns and providing clear boundaries for
components.
3. Flexibility: It allows the internal implementation details of a class to be changed without
affecting the code that uses the class.
4. Security: It prevents unauthorized access and modification of data.

5. Can you explain the principle of "data hiding" in Encapsulation?
Data hiding in Encapsulation refers to the practice of making the internal state of an object
inaccessible from outside of the object's definition. This is achieved by declaring the instance
variables of a class as private, so they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

6. What are access modifiers in Java? How do they relate to Encapsulation?
Access modifiers in Java, such as public, private, protected, and default (package-private),
are used to control the visibility of classes, variables, methods, and constructors. They play
a crucial role in Encapsulation by specifying the accessibility of the members of a class.

7. How does Encapsulation contribute to the concept of information hiding?
Encapsulation contributes to the concept of information hiding by encapsulating the internal
state of objects and providing controlled access to it. This prevents the details of the
implementation from being exposed and allows changes to be made to the internal representation
of objects without affecting the code that uses them.

8. Can you provide an example of Encapsulation in a real-world scenario?
Example of Encapsulation: Consider a class representing a bank account. It may have private
instance variables such as accountNumber and balance, along with public methods like deposit()
and withdraw() to interact with these variables. By encapsulating these variables and methods,
we ensure that the account data remains consistent and cannot be directly modified from outside
the class.

9. What happens if we don't use Encapsulation in our Java code?
Without using Encapsulation, the internal state of objects would be exposed, making them prone
to accidental modification and manipulation. This could lead to data inconsistency and
compromise the integrity of the code.

10. Can Encapsulation be achieved without using access modifiers?
No, Encapsulation cannot be achieved without using access modifiers. Access modifiers are
essential for controlling the visibility of class members and enforcing Encapsulation
principles.

11. What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction?
Encapsulation focuses on bundling the data and methods that operate on the data into a single
unit, hiding the internal implementation details. Abstraction, on the other hand, focuses on
hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
While Encapsulation is about data hiding and access control, Abstraction is about simplifying
the interface.

12. How can we implement Encapsulation in a Java class?
Encapsulation in a Java class can be implemented by:
Declaring the instance variables of the class as private.
Providing public getter and setter methods to access and modify these variables, respectively.
Controlling access to the internal state of the object through these getter and setter methods.

13. What are the different access levels provided by Java access modifiers?
Access levels provided by Java access modifiers:
Private: Accessible only within the same class.
Default (no modifier): Accessible only within the same package.
Protected: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
Public: Accessible from any other class.

14. Can you explain the concept of "getter" and "setter" methods in Encapsulation?
Getter and setter methods in Encapsulation are used to access and modify the private variables
of a class, respectively. Getter methods retrieve the value of a variable, while setter methods
set or modify the value of a variable. These methods provide controlled access to the
encapsulated data.

15. How does Encapsulation help in maintaining code integrity and security?
Encapsulation helps in maintaining code integrity and security by:
1. Preventing direct access to internal data, reducing the chances of accidental modification.
2. Enforcing access control through access modifiers, ensuring that data is accessed and modified
only through designated methods.
3. Facilitating code maintenance and evolution by encapsulating implementation details, allowing
changes to be made without affecting other parts of the codebase.
4. Enhancing code readability and understandability by providing clear boundaries and encapsulating
related functionality within classes
