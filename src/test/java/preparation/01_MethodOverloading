What is Method Overloading?

How is Method Overloading different from Method Overriding?

What are the criteria for method overloading?

Can we overload methods by changing the return type?

Give an example of method overloading in Java?

Explain the concept of Varargs in method overloading?

How does the compiler determine which method to call during method overloading?

Can methods be overloaded in the same class if they have the same parameters but different return types?

Explain the role of autoboxing and widening in method overloading?

Can you overload methods based on the order of parameters?

What happens if you have two overloaded methods that differ only in the number of parameters,
but one of them has a varargs parameter?

Consider two overloaded methods, one with a parameter of type int and the other with a parameter
of type long. If you call the method with an int argument, which method will be invoked?

How does autoboxing and unboxing affect method overloading?

Explain the behavior if you have two overloaded methods, one with a parameter of type Object and
the other with a parameter of type String, and you pass a null argument?

Can you overload methods in the same class with different access modifiers?

Consider two overloaded methods, one with a parameter of type int[] and the other with varargs of
type int. If you call the method with multiple int arguments, which method will be invoked?

Explain the behavior if you have two overloaded methods, one with a parameter of type double and
the other with a parameter of type float, and you pass a float argument?

Can you overload methods by changing only the return type and using generics?

Scenario: Overloaded Methods with Inheritance
Suppose you have a base class with an overloaded method, and a subclass that overrides one of those
methods. Explain the rules and considerations when it comes to method overloading and overriding in
this scenario?

Complex Scenario: Varargs and Array Parameters
Consider a class with two overloaded methodsâ€”one that takes an array of integers and the other that
takes varargs of integers. If you call the method with multiple integer arguments, how does the
compiler decide which method to invoke?

Real-world Scenario: API Design
Imagine you are designing a library or API that involves method overloading. How would you structure
the overloaded methods to ensure clarity, usability, and avoid potential pitfalls for developers
using your library?

Scenario: Overloaded Constructors and Methods
Suppose you have a class with overloaded constructors and overloaded methods. Describe a scenario
where both constructor and method overloading are used together and explain how the compiler
resolves method calls?

Complex Scenario: Generics and Method Overloading
Create a scenario involving generic methods and overloaded methods. Discuss the challenges and
considerations when dealing with generic types in the context of method overloading?

Scenario: Overloaded Methods with Autoboxing and Widening
Consider a class with overloaded methods, one that takes a primitive int and another that takes
an Integer. Explain how autoboxing and widening play a role in method resolution when calling
these methods?

Real-world Scenario: Database Interaction
Imagine designing a database interaction class with methods for inserting data. How would you use
method overloading to handle different data types, such as strings, integers, and dates, while
maintaining a clean and intuitive API?
