Questions
=========
What is method overriding in Java?

What are the rules for method overriding in Java?

Can the overridden method be private or static?

What is the @Override annotation used for in method overriding?

Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding.

What is the significance of the super keyword in method overriding?

Can a subclass override a private method in its superclass?

How does method overriding support polymorphism in Java?

What is covariant return type in method overriding?

Explain the concept of dynamic method dispatch in method overriding?

Can a subclass override a static method in its superclass? Why or why not?

What happens if the return type of the overriding method is a subtype of the return type of the
overridden method?

Explain the role of the super() keyword in the context of method overriding?

If a superclass method throws an exception, can the overridden method in the subclass throw a
broader exception? Why or why not?

Consider a scenario where a superclass and its subclass both have a method with the same name
and parameters. If an object of the subclass is created and the method is called, which method
will be executedâ€”superclass or subclass?

Can you override a method and change its access level (e.g., from protected to private) in the
subclass?

What is the difference between hiding a method and overriding it? Provide an example.

Explain the concept of final methods in the context of method overriding.

If a method is marked as final in the superclass, can it be overridden in the subclass? Why or
why not?

Consider a scenario where a superclass has a private method and a public method with the same
name. Can the subclass override the public method?

Explain the role of the throws clause in method overriding. How does it impact the exception
hierarchy, and what considerations should be taken when handling checked and unchecked exceptions?

Discuss the scenarios in which the super keyword is necessary and beneficial during method overriding.
Provide examples to illustrate your points.

In a scenario where a class implements multiple interfaces, each with a method of the same name but
different parameter lists, how can method overriding be achieved, and what challenges might arise?

Consider a situation where a class extends another class and implements an interface, both of which
have a method with the same name. Discuss the resolution of method invocation and how the compiler
and runtime determine which method is called.

Explain the concept of the "Bridge Method" in the context of method overriding, particularly when
dealing with generics. Provide an example to demonstrate how bridge methods are generated and their
significance.

Discuss the impact of covariant return types on method overriding. Provide insights into how it
contributes to code flexibility and potential challenges it may introduce.

In a scenario where a class overrides a method in its superclass, and the overridden method has a
generic return type, how does type erasure affect the overridden method, and what precautions should
be taken?

Examine the interaction between method overriding and the default methods introduced in Java 8
interfaces. How does this feature impact the design and evolution of class hierarchies?

Discuss the implications of method overriding in the context of multithreading. How can synchronization,
volatile, or other concurrency mechanisms affect the behavior of overridden methods in a multithreaded
environment?

Consider a scenario where a class overrides a method from its superclass, and the overridden method
calls a private method in the superclass. How does access to the private method impact method
overriding, and what are the implications for encapsulation?

Can you override a generic method in Java? Explain any challenges or considerations when overriding
methods with generics? How does type erasure impact method overriding with generics?

Overriding equals() and hashCode(): Why is it important to override equals() and hashCode() methods
in Java when customizing object comparison behavior?

Discuss potential pitfalls when overriding these methods and how to ensure proper object equality
and hashing?

How does method overriding affect how reflection is used to access methods at runtime?

Explain how reflection can be used to bypass access modifiers or invoke overridden methods in
complex inheritance hierarchies?

Can you override methods in anonymous inner classes? If so, are there any special considerations?

Discuss the relationship between method overriding and the scope of variables within anonymous
inner classes?

Explain the concept of bridge methods in Java and their role in method overriding?

When are bridge methods generated by the compiler, and how do they impact method resolution during
overriding?
