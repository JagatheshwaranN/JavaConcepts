            Java Coding Standard
            ====================
            1.	Whenever we are writing the JAVA code it is highly recommended to follow the coding standards.

            2.	Whenever we are writing any component, the name of the component should represent the purpose
                of the component (Functionality).

            3.	The main advantage of this approach is the readability and maintainability of the code is improved.

            Example,
            ========
            package com.training.operation

            public class Calculate {

                public static void main(String[] args){

                    System.out.println(Calculate.sum(10,20));
                }
                public static int sum(int x, int y){

                    return x+y;
                }
            }
        */
    }
}
