            Virtual Machine
            ===============
            It is software simulation of a machine which can perform operations like
            a physical machine. There are 2 types of VMs,
            1.	Hardware / System based VM
            2.	Application / Process-based VM

            Hardware/System based VM
            ========================
            It provides several logical systems on the same computer with strong isolation
            from each other. i.e., on one physical machine, we are defining multiple logical
            machines. The main advantage of Hardware-based VM is Hardware resources sharing
            and improving utilization of hardware resources.

            Example,
            KVM (Kernel-Based VM for Linux systems), VMWare, Xen, Cloud computing, etc.

            Application/Process based VM
            ============================
            These VMs acts as Runtime engines to run the particular programming language
            applications.

            Example,
            JVM (Java Virtual Machine), acts as runtime engine to run the Java-based applications.
            PVM (Parrot Virtual Machine), acts as runtime engine to run the Perl-based applications.
            CLR (Common Language Runtime), acts as runtime engine to run the .Net based applications.
