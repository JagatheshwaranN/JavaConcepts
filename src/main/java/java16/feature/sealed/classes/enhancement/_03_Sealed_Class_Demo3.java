 * The instanceof expression in the below code tests a reference of type Process

 * assignment-compatible with a sealed class will be known to the compiler, and
 * if none implements the interface in question, the compiler could reject the
 * code outright.
 * 
 * However, in this case, the FastProcess class is marked non-sealed, and
 * because of this, itâ€™s possible for this class to have subclasses that are not
 * known to the compiler at this time, and those subclasses might possibly
 * implement the Loggable interface. Because of this possibility, the compiler
 * accepts the code and compiles the test as written.
