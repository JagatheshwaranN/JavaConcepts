Introduction
============

JPackage allows developers to create such an installable package for their JAR files. 
The user doesn't have to explicitly copy the JAR file or even install Java to run the application. 
The installable package takes care of all of this.

The jpackage tool is being developed based on JDK Enhancement Proposal 343. 
You can use this tool to create a platform-specific installer for a Java application, which in turn installs 
the application and the JRE required for it.

Platform-specific means that the installer feels familiar to users of a particular platform. On Windows, 
for example, this is an .msi or .exe file that is launched by double-clicking it. For macOS, a .pkg or .dmg file. 
And for Linux, a .deb or .rpm file.

Java 14 introduces a new packaging tool, jpackage based on javapackager. 
javapackager was introduced in Java 8 and was part of JavaFX kit. 
As JavaFX is split from Java from 11 version, this packaging tool is no more available in standard offering.

This new tool is developed to provide native installer for an operating system. For example, an msi/exe for windows, 
pkg/dmg for MacOS, deb/rpm for Linux and so on. Without this tool, developer generally share a jar file which a user 
has to run within own JVM.

Developer can use jlink to compress the required JDK modules to minimum modules and use the jpackage to create a 
lightweight image.


Steps to convert Jar into .exe file
===================================

Step-1:
Create your project/required java class
Compile and Run
D:\Environment_Collection\Eclipse_Env\Workspace\Java_Concepts>Javac Test.java
D:\Environment_Collection\Eclipse_Env\Workspace\Java_Concepts>java Test
 
Step-2:
Create a executable jar file.
jar -cfe jpDemo3.jar org.java14.JPackDemo org/java14/*.class
jar -cfe JPKDemo.jar Java_Concepts/Test Test.class Test$1.class
D:\Environment_Collection\Eclipse_Env\Workspace\Java_Concepts>jar -cfe JPKDemo.jar Java_Concepts/Test Test.class Test$1.class

Step-3:
Install Wix 3.0 or able and set path under system variable.
Download wix from https://wixtoolset.org/.

Step-4:
Use JPackaging tool/Command line utility to create exe file
Command to create exe file: 
jpackage --input . --name JPackageDemoApp --main-jar JPKGDemo.jar --main-class org.java14.JPackDemo --type exe   --java-options '--enable-preview' --win-shortcut
jpackage --input . --name JPackageDemoApp --main-jar JPKDemo.jar --main-class Java_Concepts/Test --type exe --java-options '--enable-preview' --win-shortcut
D:\Environment_Collection\Eclipse_Env\Jars>jpackage --input . --name JPackageDemoApp --main-jar JPKDemo.jar --main-class Java_Concepts/Test --type exe --java-options '--enable-preview' --win-shortcut

Step-5:
In step-4 the .exe file will get created, you can use the .exe file to instal the same.
Install your exe into ur window desktop/laptop
