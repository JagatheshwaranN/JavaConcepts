            CommandLine Arguments
            =====================
            The arguments which are passed from the command prompt are called as Command Line arguments. With these
            command line arguments, the JVM will create an array and by passing that array as argument, the JVM will
            call main method.

            The main objective of the command line argument is we can customize the behavior of the main method.

            Ques: Why String[] args is used as command line argument?
            String is the mostly used data type and the conversion from string data type to other data types are easy
            and available.

            Within main method, the command line arguments are available in String form.

            Usually, space is the separator between the command line arguments. If our command line arguments itself
            contains the space, then we have to enclose those command line arguments within double quotes.
