            Instance Variable
            =================
            1.	If the value of the variable is varied from object to object, then such type of variable
                is called as Instance variable.

            2.	For every object, a separate copy of the instance variable will be created.

            3.	Instance variable should be declared within the class directly but outside any method,
                block or constructor.

            4.	Instance variable will be created at the time of the object creation and destroyed at the
                time of the object destruction. Hence, the scope of the instance variable is exactly same
                as the object.

            5.	Instance variables will be stored in the heap memory as part of the object.

            6.	The instance variable canâ€™t be accessed directly from the static area / method, but we can
                access by using the object reference.

            7.  We can access instance variable directly from the instance area / method.

            8.	For Instance variables, JVM will always provide the default values, and we are not required
                to perform initialization explicitly.

            9.	Instance variables are also known as object level variables or attributes.
