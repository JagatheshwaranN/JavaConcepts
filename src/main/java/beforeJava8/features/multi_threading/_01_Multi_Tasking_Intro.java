            Multi-Tasking
            =============
            Executing several tasks simultaneously is a concept of Multi-Tasking.
            There are 2 types of Multi-Tasking,
            1.	Process Based Multi-Tasking
            2.	Thread Based Multi-Tasking

            Process Based Multi-Tasking
            ===========================
            Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a separate
            independent program (process) is called as Process Based Multi Tasking.

            Example,
            While typing a java program in an editor, we can listen to audio song
            from the same system. At the same time, we can download a file from the
            internet. All these tasks will be executed simultaneously and independent
            of each other and hence it is Process Based Multi Tasking. It's best
            suitable at OS level.

            Thread Based Multi-Tasking
            ==========================
            Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a separate independent
            part of the same program is called as Thread Based Multi Tasking. Each independent
            part is called as Thread. It's best suitable at programmatic level.

            Main Objective of Multi Tasking
            ===============================
            Whether it is process based or thread based, the main objective of the Multi Tasking
            is to reduce the response time of the system and to improve the performance.

            Application Areas of Multi Tasking
            ==================================
            The main important application areas of Multi Tasking are,
            1.	To develop Multi Media graphics
            2.	To develop Animations
            3.	To develop Video Games
            4.	To develop Web Servers and Application Servers, etc.

            Java Support for Multi Tasking
            ==============================
            When compared with the old languages, developing Multi Tasking applications with Java
            is very easy because the Java provides inbuilt support for Multi Tasking with rich APIs
            (Thread, Runnable, ThreadGroup, etc.)
