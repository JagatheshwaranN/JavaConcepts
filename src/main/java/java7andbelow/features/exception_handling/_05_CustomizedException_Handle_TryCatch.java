            Customized Exception Handling by using Try Catch
            ================================================
            Its highly recommended to handle the exceptions. The code which may raise
            an exception is called as risky code and we have to define that code inside
            the try block and the corresponding handling code inside the catch block.
            try {
                Risky code
            }
            Catch (Exception ex) {
                Handling code
            }
        */
    }
}
