            Java 1.7 version Enhancements WRT Exception Handling
            ====================================================
            As a part of Java 1.7 version, in exception handling, the following 2 concepts
            are introduced.
            1.	Try with Resources
            2.	Multi Catch Block

            Try with Resources
            ==================
            Until Java 1.6 version, it's highly recommended to write the finally block to
            close the resources which are opened as part of the try block.
