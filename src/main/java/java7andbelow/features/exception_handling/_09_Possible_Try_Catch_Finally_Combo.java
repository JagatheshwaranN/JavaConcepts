        /*
            Various possible combination of Try Catch Finally
            =================================================
            1.	In Try Catch Finally, the order is important.

            2.	Whenever we are writing the try compulsory, we should write either catch or finally
                otherwise we will get the compile time error. i.e., try without catch/finally is
                invalid.

            3.	Whenever we are writing the catch block compulsory try block must be required i.e.,
                catch without try is invalid.

            4.	Whenever we are writing the finally block compulsory try block must be required i.e.,
                finally without try is invalid.

            5.	Inside try catch and finally blocks we can declare the try catch and finally blocks.
                i.e., nesting of the try catch finally is allowed.

            6.	For try catch finally blocks, curly braces are mandatory.
