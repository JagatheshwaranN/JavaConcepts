            List(Interface)
            ===============
            It is the child interface of Collection. If we want to represent a group of individual
            objects as a single entity where "duplicates are allowed" and "insertion order" must be
            preserved, then we should go for a List.

            List (I) 1.2 v

            The classes which implements List interface are as below.

            1. ArrayList (C) 1.2 v
            2. LinkedList (C) 1.2 v
            3. Vector (C) 1.0 v
            4. Stack (C) 1.0 v

            Note: In 1.2 version of Java, Vector and Stack classes are reengineered to implement
                  the List interface.
