            Collection
            ==========
            If we want to represent the group of individual objects as single entity then
            we should go for Collection.

            Collection Framework
            ====================
            It contains several classes and interfaces, which can be used to represent the
            group of individual objects as a single entity.

            Java	                        C++

            9 Key Interfaces of Collection Framework
            ========================================
            1.	Collection
            2.	List
            3.	Set
            4.	SortedSet
            5.	NavigableSet
            6.	Queue
            7.	Map
            8.	SortedMap

            Collection (Interface)
            ======================
            If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity, then we
            should go for collection. Collection interface defines the most common methods
            which are applicable for any collection object. In general, collection interface
            is considered as a root interface of a collection framework. There is no concrete
            class that implements collection interface directly.

            Collection vs Collections
            =========================
            Collection is an interface, if we want to represent a group of individual objects
            as a single entity, then we should go for collection.

            Collections are a utility class present in the java.util package to define several
            utility methods for Collection objects like sorting, searching, etc.
