            1.	The underlying DSA is Hashtable
            2.	The insertion order is not preserved, and itâ€™s based on hashCode of keys.
            3.	Duplicate keys aren't allowed, but values can be duplicated.
            4.	Heterogeneous objects allowed for both key and value.
            5.	Null is allowed for a key only once.
            6.	Null is allowed for value any number of times.
            7.	HashMap implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
            8.	It is the best choice if our frequent operation is searching operation.
