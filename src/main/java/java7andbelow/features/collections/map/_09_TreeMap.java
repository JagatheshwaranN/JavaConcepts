            1.	The underlying DSA is RED-BLACK tree.
            2.	Insertion order is not preserved, and it is based on some sorting order of Keys
            3.	Duplicate keys are not allowed, but values can be duplicates
            4.	If we are depending on the default natural sorting order, then keys should be
                homogenous and comparable otherwise; we will get the runtime exception, saying CCE.
                If we are defining our own sorting by comparator, then keys need not be homogenous
                and comparable.
            5.	Whether we are depending on default natural sorting order or customized sorting order,
                there are no restrictions for values. We can take heterogeneous and non-comparable
                objects as well.
