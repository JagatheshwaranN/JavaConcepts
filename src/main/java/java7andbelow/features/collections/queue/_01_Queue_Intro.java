            Queue (Interface)
            =================
            It is the child interface of Collection. If we want to represent a group of individual
            objects prior to processing, then we should go for queue. Usually, queue follows FIFO
            order, but based on requirement, we can implement our own priority as well.

            For Example, before sending an email, we have to store all email-ids in some Data
            Structures. In which order we added email-ids the same order only mails should
            be delivered, for this requirement, queue is best choice.

            Queue (I) 1.5 v
            PriorityQueue (I) 1.5 v
            BlockingQueue (I) 1.5 v

            The classes which implement BlockingQueue interface are as below.

            1. PriorityBlockingQueue (C) 1.5 v
            2. LinkedBlockingQueue (C) 1.5 v
