            By implementing Runnable Interface
            ==================================
            We can define a Thread by implementing the Runnable Interface. Runnable
            Interface present in java.lang package, and it contains only one method
            which is run() method.

            MyThread   => Thread(C)  => Runnable(I) <=> Approach 1
            MyRunnable => Runnable(I)  <=> Approach 2

            Note: We will get mixed output and we canâ€™t tell the exact output.
