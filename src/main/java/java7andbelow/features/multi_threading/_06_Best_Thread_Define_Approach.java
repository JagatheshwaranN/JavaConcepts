            Best Thread Define Approach
            ===========================
            1. Among two ways of defining a thread, implements Runnable approach is recommended.

            2. In first approach, our class always extends Thread class, there is no chance of
               extending any other class. Hence, we are missing the inheritance benefit.

            3. In second approach, while implementing Runnable interface we can extend any other
               class. Hence, we wonâ€™t miss any inheritance benefit.

            4. Because of the above reason, implementing Runnable Interface approach is
               recommended than extending the Thread class.
