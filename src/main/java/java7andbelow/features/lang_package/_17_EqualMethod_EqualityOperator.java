            Relation Between == Operator & Equals() Method

            1.	If two objects are equal by == operator, then those objects are always equal
                by equals() method i.e., if reference1 == reference2 is true then
                reference1.equals(reference2) is always true.

            2.	If two objects are not equal by == operator then we can't conclude anything about
                equals() method. It may return true / false i.e., if reference1 == reference2 is
                false then reference1.equals(reference2) may return true / false.

            3.	If two objects are equal by equals() method then we can't conclude anything about

                true then we can't conclude anything about reference1 == reference2 it may return
                true/false.

            4.	If two objects are not equal by equals() method then these objects are not equal
                by == operator i.e., if reference1.equals(reference2) is false then
                reference1 == reference2 is always false.

            1. To use == operator compulsory there should be some relation between argument types
               such as either parent-child, child-parent or same type. Otherwise, we will get the
               CTE - Incomparable types.

            2. If there is no relation between the arguments, then the equals() method won't raise
               CTE or RTE. It simply returns the false.
