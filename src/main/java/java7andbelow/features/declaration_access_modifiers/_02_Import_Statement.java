            =====
            The problem with usage of fully qualified name every time is, it increases the length of the
            code and reduces the readability of the code. We can solve this problem by using the important
            statement. Whenever we are writing the import statement itâ€™s not required to use the fully
            qualified name every time, instead we can use the short name directly.

            Types of Import Statements
            ==========================
            There are 2 types of import statements are as below,
            1.	Explicit class import (recommended)
            2.	Implicit class import
        */

        // Explicit class import
        // =====================
        // Import java.util.ArrayList - It is highly recommended to use explicit class import
        // because it improves the readability of the code.

        // Implicit class import.
        // ======================
        // Import java.util.* - It is not recommended to use this import, because it reduces the
        // readability of the code.

        /*
            Note: Whenever we are using the fully qualified name then it's not required to write import
            statement and vice versa is applicable.

            2.	Classes present in current working directory (Default package)

            import java.*;

            Difference b/w C & Java
            =======================
            Difference between the C language #include<stdio.h> and Java language import statement,
            in the case of the c language #include, all the input and output header files will be
            loaded at the beginning only (At translation time) Hence it is Static include.

            But in the case of Java import statement, no .class file will be loaded at the beginning,
            whenever we are using a particular class, then only corresponding .class file will be
            loaded. This is known as Dynamic include or Load on demand or Load on fly.
