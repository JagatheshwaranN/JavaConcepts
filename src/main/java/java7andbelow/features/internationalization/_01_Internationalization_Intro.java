            I18N Intro
            ==========
            The process of designing web applications in such a way which provides support
            for various countries and languages and currencies automatically without
            performing any change in the application, is called as Internationalization.

            For example, if the request is coming from India, then the response should be
            in India people understandable form, If the request is coming from US, then the
            response should be in US people understandable form.

            We can implement I18N by using the following 3 classes:
            1.	Locale
            2.	NumberFormat
            3.	DateFormat

        */
    }
}
