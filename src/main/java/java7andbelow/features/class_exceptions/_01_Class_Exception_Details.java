            NoClassDefFoundError
            ====================
            While using the new() operator, at runtime if the corresponding .class file is not available
            then we will get the runtime exception saying "NoClassDefFoundError".
            For example,
            Test t = new Test(); At runtime, if Test.class is not available, then RE: will trigger.

            ClassNotFoundException
            ======================
            While using the newInstance() method, at runtime if the corresponding .class is not available
            then we will get the runtime exception saying "ClassNotFoundException".
            For example,
            Object o = Class.forName(args[0]).newInstance();
            Java Test Test123; At runtime, if Test123.class is not available, then RE: will trigger.

            new()
            =====
            1. It is a operator in java
            2. We can use new() operator if we know the class name at the beginning.
            3. To use new() operator, the class not required to contain no-arg constructor.
            4. At runtime, if .class file is not available then we will get the runtime exception
               saying "NoClassDefFoundError" and which is unchecked.


            newInstance()
            =============
            1. It is an method present in java.lang.class
            2. We can use the newInstance() method, if we donâ€™t know the class name at the beginning and
               if it's available at runtime.
            3. To use newInstance() method, the class should contain the no-arg constructor. Otherwise,
               we will get RE: Instantiation Exception.
            4. At runtime, if the corresponding .class file is not available then we will get the runtime
               exception saying "ClassNotFoundException" and which is checked.
