            ==============
            In Integral arithmetic (Byte, Short, Int, and Long) there is no way to represent the infinity.
            Hence, if infinity is the result, then we will get the RE: arithmetic exception / by zero. But
            in floating point arithmetic, there is a way to represent the infinity. Because, the Float and
            Double classes contains the two constants NEGATIVE_INFINITY and POSITIVE_INFINITY. Hence,
            even though the result is infinity we wonâ€™t get any arithmetic exception in floating point
            arithmetic.
