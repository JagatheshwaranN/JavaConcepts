/**
 * Records can also be defined within methods to store intermediate values.
 * Unlike local classes, a local record is implicitly static. This means they
 * cannot access variables and instance members of the enclosing methods which
 * is actually great since it prevents capturing of values by the record. Local
 * records are a great boon for Java developers who would earlier have to create
 * helper records.
